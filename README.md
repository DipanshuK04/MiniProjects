# Web Development , Electronics  & RL Projects

This repository contains a collection of projects that combine **Web Development** and **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)**. The projects are built using a variety of technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and reinforcement learning algorithms. Each project is designed to showcase the application of these technologies in real-world scenarios.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- **WebDevelopment/**: Contains projects focused on front-end and full-stack web development.
  - **HTML_CSS_JS/**: Projects using core web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
  - **React/**: Projects developed using the React framework, focusing on building dynamic user interfaces.
  
- **DeepReinforcementLearning/**: Contains projects focused on DRL, using various reinforcement learning algorithms.
  - **RL_Basics/**: Introduction to RL concepts with simple implementations.
  - **DRL_Projects/**: Advanced DRL projects that involve complex environments and algorithms.

## Technologies Used

### Web Development
- **HTML**: Used for structuring the web pages.
- **CSS**: Used for styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: Implements interactive elements and client-side logic.
- **React**: Utilized for building user interfaces, handling state management, and creating reusable components.

### Reinforcement Learning
- **Python**: Used for implementing RL algorithms.
- **Gymnasium/PyBullet**: Simulation environments for testing RL algorithms.
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch**: Deep learning frameworks used for creating and training DRL models.

### Installation
  **Web Development Projects**:
   - Navigate to the specific project directory under `WebDevelopment/`.
   - For React projects, run the following commands:
     ```bash
     npm install
     npm start
     ```
   - Open the `.html` file in your browser for projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
